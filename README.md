Rock vs Mine Prediction Model

A Machine Learning-based model to predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine.

Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. The goal is to provide an accurate and reliable model for naval and underwater exploration applications.

Features
- Classifies underwater objects as rocks or mines using sonar data
- Uses LogisticRegression model for prediction 
- Trained on a dataset of around 200+ datas 
- Achieves an accuracy of 0.7619047619047619
